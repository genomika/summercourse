I Curso de Verão de Bionformática pela Genomika
===============================

Tema: Análise de dados NGS -  Extraindo informações clínicas de variantes genéticas.

Abstract
--------

Advances in NGS have provided unprecedented opportunities to mine genetic data from individuals to populations. The subsequent identification of genetic variants which may be implicated in disease is an important step in linking sequence data with disease and provides new approaches to improve human health. This course will explore the strategies of genomic data analysis and interpretation, an emergent discipline that seeks to deliver better answers from NGS data so that patients and their physicians can determine informed healthcare decisions.
