Preliminares
================================================================================

Softwares usados neste tutorial
----------------------------------------

- [FastQC] : A quality control tool for high-throughput sequence data.
- [cutadapt] : A tool to remove adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing data.


### Setup
##### Special stampede login
Before we start, log into stampede like you did yesterday, but use this special hostname:

     login8.stampede.tacc.utexas.edu

Remember how we emphasized yesterday that you should not perform significant computation on login nodes? Well, there are a  few exceptions, and login8.stampede.tacc.utexas.edu is one of them. Is it a dedicated login node owned by an organization our lab belongs to, so we have given you access to it for the duration of this course. This will let us do a few things at the command line that would normally set off alarm bells from the TACC folks if we all did them on a standard login node.


File formats explored in this practical:
----------------------------------------

__FastQ__. See: 

- [Wikipedia][fastq-format-wikipedia].
- [NAR 2010][fastq-format-nar].

Data used in this practical:
-------------------------------

- __f010_raw_mirna.fastq__: RNA-Seq of a [microRNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA) sample.

#### Data staging
Get the mirna data if you haven't already

Let's now set ourselves up to process this data in $SCRATCH, using some of best practices for organizing our workflow.

    # Create a $SCRATCH area to work on data for this course,
    # with a sub-directory for pre-processing raw fastq files
    mkdir -p $SCRATCH/core_ngs/fastq_prep
    # Make a symbolic links to the original yeast data in $WORK.
    cd $SCRATCH/core_ngs/fastq_prep
    ln -s -f $WORK/archive/original/2014_05.core_ngs/Sample_Yeast_L005_R1.cat.fastq.gz
    ln -s -f $WORK/archive/original/2014_05.core_ngs/Sample_Yeast_L005_R2.cat.fastq.gz


Overview
================================================================================

1. Use [FastQC] to explore the raw data.
1. Use [cutadapt] to remove adapters.
1. Use [cutadapt] to filter reads based on quality.
1. Use [FastQC] to explore the filtered data.


Exercise
================================================================================

Create an empty directory to work in the exercise and copy or download the raw data to it: 

    cd quality_control_data

<!-- new and clean data directory in the sandbox
    rm -r                                                   ../../../../sandbox/quality_control/
	cp -r ../../../../ngs_course_materials/quality_control/ ../../../../sandbox/quality_control/
    cd    ../../../../sandbox/quality_control/
-->


Explore the raw data using some Linux shell commands
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Illumina sequence data format (FASTQ)

GSAF gives you paired end sequencing data in two matching fastq format files, containing reads for each end sequenced. See where your data really is and how big it is.

    # the -l options says "long listing" which shows where the link goes,
    # but doesn't show details of the real file
    ls -l
    # the -L option says to follow the link to the real file, -l = long listing (includes size)
    # and -h says "human readable" (e.g. MB, GB)
    ls -lLh

The file __f010_raw_mirna.fastq__ contains reads form a microRNA sequencing experiment.
Use the command `head` to have a view of the first lines of the file:

    head f010_raw_mirna.fastq

Use the command `wc` to count how many reads are there in the file (remember you have to divide by 4)

    wc -l f010_raw_mirna.fastq

#### 4-line FASTQ format

Each read end sequenced is represented by a 4-line entry in the fastq file that looks like this:

    @HWI-ST1097:127:C0W5VACXX:5:1101:4820:2124 1:N:0:CTCAGA
    TCTCTAGTTTCGATAGATTGCTGATTTGTTTCCTGGTCATTAGTCTCCGTATTTATATTATTATCCTGAGCATCATTGATGGCTGCAGGAGGAGCATTCTC
    +
    CCCFFFFDHHHHHGGGHIJIJJIHHJJJHHIGHHIJFHGICA91CGIGB?9EF9DDBFCGIGGIIIID>DCHGCEDH@C@DC?3AB?@B;AB??;=A>3;; 

**Line 1** is the unique read name. The format is as follows, using the read name above:

     machine_id:lane:flowcell_grid_coordinates  end_number:failed_qc:0:barcode
     @HWI-ST1097:127:C0W5VACXX:5:1101:4820:2124 1:N:0:CTCAGA

The line as a whole will be unique for this read fragment. However, the corresponding R1 and R2 reads will have identical machine_id:lane:flowcell_grid_coordinates information. This common part of the name ties the two read ends together.

Most sequencing facilities will not give you qc-failed reads (failed_qc = Y) unless you ask for them.

**Line 2** is the sequence reported by the machine, starting with the first base of the insert (the 5' adapter has been removed by the sequencing facility). These are ACGT or N uppercase characters.

**Line 3** is always '+' from GSAF (it can optionally include a sequence description)

**Line 4** is a string of Ascii-encoded base quality scores, one character per base in the sequence.
For each base, an integer Phred-type quality score is calculated as integer score = -10 log(probabilty base is wrong) then added to 33 to make a number in the Ascii printable character range. As you can see from the table below, alphabetical letters - good, numbers – ok, most special characters – bad (except :;<=>?@).

Explore the raw data quality using FastQC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First create a directory to store the results of the fastqc analysis:

    mkdir f020_res_fastqc

Then execute `fastqc` storing the results in the created directory (option `-o`):

    fastqc -o f020_res_fastqc f010_raw_mirna.fastq

Find the results in the __fastqc_report.html__ file and discus them.

There are many _Overrepresented sequences_. 
Explore whether some of them correspond to miRNAs using the [miRBase search](http://www.mirbase.org/search.shtml) __By sequence__ utility.


Handling adapters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 2 known adapters used in this experiment: 

    CTGGGAAATCACCATAAACGTGAAATGTCTTTGGATTTGGGAATCTTATAAGTTCTGTATGAGACCACTCTAAAAA
    CTTTTTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAGATATATAAAGCCAAGAAATCGAAATACTTTCAAGTTACGGTAAGC

Use the command grep to see whether they are still present in your data:

    grep "CTGGGAAATCACCATAAACGTGAAATGTCTTTGGATTTGGGAATCTTATAAGTTCTGTATGAGACCACTCTAAAAA" f010_raw_mirna.fastq 
	grep "CTTTTTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAGATATATAAAGCCAAGAAATCGAAATACTTTCAAGTTACGGTAAGC" f010_raw_mirna.fastq 

Do the sequences appear systematically at the beginning or at the end of the reads?



But the adapters could also appear in the _reverse_, _complementary_ or _reverse complementary_ mode.

Compute the _reverse_, _complementary_ and the _reverse complementary_ sequences of the two adapters,
and find out which of them appear in your data.

To compute those sequences you can use some online resources as the one in:  
<http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/rev_comp.html>


<!--
Or to use R-Bioconductor to compute their reverse, complementary and reverse complementary.

library (Biostrings)
myseq <- DNAString ("CTTTTTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAGATATATAAAGCCAAGAAATCGAAATACTTTCAAGTTACGGTAAGC")
reverse (myseq)
complement (myseq)
reverseComplement (myseq)

-->

Use grep form Linux shell to find out which of the versions of the adapter is in your data.


### Adapter 1

    grep CTGGGAAATCACCATAAACGTGAAATGTCTTTGGATTTGGGAATCTTATAAGTTCTGTATGAGACCACTCTAAAAA f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l  ## present in the sample (at the beginning of the reads)
	
    grep GACCCTTTAGTGGTATTTGCACTTTACAGAAACCTAAACCCTTAGAATATTCAAGACATACTCTGGTGAGATTTTT f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep TTTTTAGAGTGGTCTCATACAGAACTTATAAGATTCCCAAATCCAAAGACATTTCACGTTTATGGTGATTTCCCAG f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l  ## present in the sample (at the end of the read) ... but not so numerous
	
    grep AAAAATCTCACCAGAGTATGTCTTGAATATTCTAAGGGTTTAGGTTTCTGTAAAGTGCAAATACCACTAAAGGGTC f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 

But sometimes the adapter does not appear complete. 
It may be there just the first part:

    grep CTGGGAAATCACCATAAACGTGAAATGTCTTTGGA f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep GACCCTTTAGTGGTATTTGCACTTTACAGAAACCT f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep TTTTTAGAGTGGTCTCATACAGAACTTATAAGATT f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep AAAAATCTCACCAGAGTATGTCTTGAATATTCTAA f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 

or the end part of it:

    grep AATCTTATAAGTTCTGTATGAGACCACTCTAAAAA f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep TTAGAATATTCAAGACATACTCTGGTGAGATTTTT f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep TCCAAAGACATTTCACGTTTATGGTGATTTCCCAG f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep AGGTTTCTGTAAAGTGCAAATACCACTAAAGGGTC f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 

NOTE: in the code above I did cut just the 35 first or last nucleotides of the primer in its different arrangements, 
but this is an arbitrary length. 
We are just trying to discover which of the arrangements are present in our sample
and whether there are allocated in the 5' or in the 6' end.


### Adapter 2

    grep CTTTTTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAGATATATAAAGCCAAGAAATCGAAATACTTTCAAGTTACGGTAAGC f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l   ## present in the sample (at the end of the read) ... but not so numerous
	
    grep GAAAAAAAGCAGGAAAGGTGTTCTATATATTTCGGTTCTTTAGCTTTATGAAAGTTCAATGCCATTCG f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep GCTTACCGTAACTTGAAAGTATTTCGATTTCTTGGCTTTATATATCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAAAAAAG f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l   ## present in the sample (at the beginning of the reads)
	
    grep CGAATGGCATTGAACTTTCATAAAGCTAAAGAACCGAAATATATAGAACACCTTTCCTGCTTTTTTTC f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 

As before, sometimes the adapter does not appear complete. 
It may be there just the first part:

    grep CTTTTTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAGATATATA f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep GAAAAAAAGCAGGAAAGGTGTTCTATATAT f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep GCTTACCGTAACTTGAAAGTATTTCGATTT f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep CGAATGGCATTGAACTTTCATAAAGCTAAA f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 

or the end part of it:

    grep AAGCCAAGAAATCGAAATACTTTCAAGTTACGGTAAGC f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep TTCGGTTCTTTAGCTTTATGAAAGTTCAATGCCATTCG f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep CTTGGCTTTATATATCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAAAAAAG f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep GAACCGAAATATATAGAACACCTTTCCTGCTTTTTTTC f010_raw_mirna.fastq | wc -l 



Use cutadapt to make an adapter trimming of the reads.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check the options:

- __-a__ for adapter to the 3' end.
- __-g__ for adapter to the 5' end.

you can find the help of the program typing `cutadapt -h` in the shell. 

To get read of the the adapters found in our data we run [cutadapt] several times:

    cutadapt -g CTGGGAAATCACCATAAACGTGAAATGTCTTTGGATTTGGGAATCTTATAAGTTCTGTATGAGACCACTCTAAAAA -o f030_mirna_trim1.fastq f010_raw_mirna.fastq
	
    cutadapt -a TTTTTAGAGTGGTCTCATACAGAACTTATAAGATTCCCAAATCCAAAGACATTTCACGTTTATGGTGATTTCCCAG -o f030_mirna_trim2.fastq f030_mirna_trim1.fastq
	
    cutadapt -g GCTTACCGTAACTTGAAAGTATTTCGATTTCTTGGCTTTATATATCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAAAAAAG         -o f030_mirna_trim3.fastq f030_mirna_trim2.fastq
	
    cutadapt -a CTTTTTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAGATATATAAAGCCAAGAAATCGAAATACTTTCAAGTTACGGTAAGC         -o f030_mirna_trim4.fastq f030_mirna_trim3.fastq


Now you can `grep` again searching for the adapters

### Adapter 1

    grep CTGGGAAATCACCATAAACGTGAAATGTCTTTGGATTTGGGAATCTTATAAGTTCTGTATGAGACCACTCTAAAAA f030_mirna_trim4.fastq | wc -l
	
    #grep GACCCTTTAGTGGTATTTGCACTTTACAGAAACCTAAACCCTTAGAATATTCAAGACATACTCTGGTGAGATTTTT f030_mirna_trim4.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep TTTTTAGAGTGGTCTCATACAGAACTTATAAGATTCCCAAATCCAAAGACATTTCACGTTTATGGTGATTTCCCAG f030_mirna_trim4.fastq | wc -l
	
    #grep AAAAATCTCACCAGAGTATGTCTTGAATATTCTAAGGGTTTAGGTTTCTGTAAAGTGCAAATACCACTAAAGGGTC f030_mirna_trim4.fastq | wc -l 

### Adapter 2

    grep CTTTTTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAGATATATAAAGCCAAGAAATCGAAATACTTTCAAGTTACGGTAAGC f030_mirna_trim4.fastq | wc -l
	
    #grep GAAAAAAAGCAGGAAAGGTGTTCTATATATTTCGGTTCTTTAGCTTTATGAAAGTTCAATGCCATTCG f030_mirna_trim4.fastq | wc -l 
	
    grep GCTTACCGTAACTTGAAAGTATTTCGATTTCTTGGCTTTATATATCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAAAAAAG f030_mirna_trim4.fastq | wc -l
	
    #grep CGAATGGCATTGAACTTTCATAAAGCTAAAGAACCGAAATATATAGAACACCTTTCCTGCTTTTTTTC f030_mirna_trim4.fastq | wc -l 



Explore the quality of the trimmed file using FastQC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check the data quality again using fastqc:

	mkdir f040_res_fastqc_trimmed
	fastqc -o f040_res_fastqc_trimmed f030_mirna_trim4.fastq

Some of the reads seems to be too short and some others may not have enough quality. 


Use cutadapt to filter reads by quality and length. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check the options:

- __-q__ quality cutoff.
- __-m__ minimum length.
- __-M__ maximum length.

you can find the help of the program typing `cutadapt -h` in the shell. 

Run cutadapt for length and quality purge of the reads.

    cutadapt -m 17 -M 30 -q 10 -o f040_mirna_cut.fastq f030_mirna_trim4.fastq


Check the data quality again using fastqc:

	mkdir f050_res_fastqc_trimmed_purged
	
	fastqc -o f050_res_fastqc_trimmed_purged f040_mirna_cut.fastq


Explore again the _Overrepresented sequences_ in [mirbase] (Search -> By sequence).

Count how many reads are left for the analysis (divide by 4)

    wc -l f010_raw_mirna.fastq
	
    wc -l f040_mirna_cut.fastq
