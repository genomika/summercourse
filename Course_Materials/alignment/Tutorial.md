# Preliminaries

In this hands-on will learn how to align DNAseq data with most widely used software today. Building a whole genome index requires a lot of RAM memory and almost one hour in a typical workstation, for this reason **in this tutorial we will work with targeted panel of genes data** to speed up the exercises. The same steps would be done for a whole genome alignment.

Once raw sequence files are generated (in FASTQ format) and quality-checked, the next step in most NGS pipelines is mapping to a reference genome. For individual sequences of interest, it is common to use a tool like BLAST to identify genes or species of origin. However, a typical example NGS dataset may have tens to hundreds of millions of reads, which BLAST and similar tools are not designed to handle.
Thus, a large set of computational tools have been developed to quickly, and with sufficient (but not absolute) accuracy align each read to its best location, if any, in a reference. Even though many mapping tools exist, a few individual programs have a dominant "market share" of the NGS world. These programs vary widely in their design, inputs, outputs, and applications. In this section, we will primarily focus on two of the most versatile mappers: BWA and Bowtie2 (only comments).

### NGS aligners discussed:

- [BWA] : BWA is a software package for mapping **DNA** low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome.
- [Bowtie2] : *Bowtie 2* is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning **DNA** sequencing reads to long reference sequences (only comments).

### Other software used in this hands-on:
- [SAMTools] : SAM Tools **provide various utilities** for manipulating alignments in the SAM format, including sorting, merging, indexing and generating alignments in a per-position format.
- [Picard] : Piccard Tools **provide various utilities** for handling alignments in the SAM and BAM format, including sorting, merging, indexing and generating alignments in a per-position format.

### File formats explored:

- [SAM](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAMv1.pdf): Sequence alignment format, plain text.
- [BAM](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/bam): Binary and compressed version of SAM


### Data used in this practical

You have already worked with two human data samples, which we will continue to use here.  The paired end data should already be located at:

    $WORK/archive/original/2014_05.core_ngs

- Sample_Yeast_L005_R1.cat.fastq.gz	Paired-end Illumina, First of pair, FASTQ	Yeast ChIP-seq
- Sample_Yeast_L005_R2.cat.fastq.gz	Paired-end Illumina, Second of pair, FASTQ	Yeast ChIP-seq

First copy the two human datasets to your $SCRATCH/core_ngs/fastq_prep directory.

    cd $SCRATCH/core_ngs/fastq_prep
    cp $CLASSDIR/human_stuff/*rnaseq.fastq.gz .

Create a $SCRATCH/core_ngs/align directory and make a link to the fastq_prep directory.

    mkdir -p $SCRATCH/core_ngs/align
    cd $SCRATCH/core_ngs/align
    ln -s -f ../fastq_prep fq
    ls -l
    ls fq

#### Reference Genomes

Before we get to alignment, we need a genome to align to.  We will use the human genome (hg19) here.

    hg19	Human	3.1 Gbp	25 (really 93)	UCSC	UCSC GoldenPath

Searching genomes is hard work and takes a long time if done on an un-indexed, linear genomic sequence.  So aligners require that references first be indexed for quick access  The aligners we are using each require a different index, but use the same method (the Burrows-Wheeler Transform) to get the job done. This requires taking a FASTA file as input, with each chromosome (or contig) as a separate entry, and producing some aligner-specific set of files as output. Those index files are then used by the aligner when performing the sequence alignment. 

**hg19** is way too big for us to index here, so we're not going to do it. Instead, all hg19 index files are located at:

    /scratch/01063/abattenh/ref_genome/bwa/bwtsw/hg19


First stage the yeast and mirbase reference FASTA files in your work archive area in a directory called references.

    mkdir -p $WORK/archive/references/fasta
    cp $CLASSDIR/references/*.fa $WORK/archive/references/fasta/

 With that, we're ready to get started on the first exercise.

Exercise #1: BWA – Yeast ChIP-seq

We will perform a global alignment of the paired-end Yeast ChIP-seq sequences using bwa. This workflow generally has the following steps:


- Trim the FASTQ sequences down to 50 with fastx_clipper
   - this removes most of any 5' adapter contamination without the fuss of specific adapter trimming w/cutadapt
- Prepare the sacCer3 reference index for bwa (one time) using bwa index
- Perform a global bwa alignment on the R1 reads (bwa aln) producing a BWA-specific binary .sai intermediate file
- Perform a global bwa alignment on the R2 reads (bwa aln) producing a BWA-specific binary .sai intermediate file
- Perform pairing of the separately aligned reads and report the alignments in SAM format using bwa sampe
- Convert the SAM file to a BAM file (samtools view)
- Sort the BAM file by genomic location (samtools sort)
- Index the BAM file (samtools index)
- Gather simple alignment statistics (samtools flagstat and samtools idxstat)

We're going to skip the trimming step for now and see how it goes. We'll perform steps 2 - 5 now and leave samtools for the next course section, since those steps (6 - 10) are common to nearly all post-alignment workflows.

### Introducing BWA


Like other tools you've worked with so far, you first need to load bwa using the module system.  Go ahead and do that now, and then enter bwa with no arguments to view the top-level help page (many NGS tools will provide some help when called with no arguments).

    bwa
    

    Program: bwa (alignment via Burrows-Wheeler transformation)
    Version: 0.7.7-r441

    Contact: Heng Li <lh3@sanger.ac.uk>
    Usage:   bwa <command> [options]
    
    Command: index         index sequences in the FASTA format
         mem           BWA-MEM algorithm
         fastmap       identify super-maximal exact matches
         pemerge       merge overlapping paired ends (EXPERIMENTAL)
         aln           gapped/ungapped alignment
         samse         generate alignment (single ended)
         sampe         generate alignment (paired ended)
         bwasw         BWA-SW for long queries
         fa2pac        convert FASTA to PAC format
         pac2bwt       generate BWT from PAC
         pac2bwtgen    alternative algorithm for generating BWT
         bwtupdate     update .bwt to the new format
         bwt2sa        generate SA from BWT and Occ
    Note: To use BWA, you need to first index the genome with `bwa index'.
      There are three alignment algorithms in BWA: `mem', `bwasw', and
      `aln/samse/sampe'. If you are not sure which to use, try `bwa mem'
      first. Please `man ./bwa.1' for the manual. 


As you can see, bwa offers a number of sub-commands one can use with to do different things.

#### Building the BWA sacCer3 index

We're going to index the genome with the index command. To learn what this sub-command needs in the way of options and arguments, enter bwa index with no arguments.

    Usage:   bwa index [-a bwtsw|is] [-c] <in.fasta>
    Options: -a STR    BWT construction algorithm: bwtsw or is [auto]
          -p STR    prefix of the index [same as fasta name]
          -6        index files named as <in.fasta>.64.* instead of <in.fasta>.*
    Warning: `-a bwtsw' does not work for short genomes, while `-a is' and
         `-a div' do not work not for long genomes. Please choose `-a'
         according to the length of the genome.


Here, we only need to specify two things:
-   the name of the FASTA file  
-   whether to use the  bwtsw or is algorithm for indexing

Since sacCer3 is relative large (~12 Mbp) we will specify bwtsw as the indexing option, and the name of the FASTA file is sacCer3.fa.

Importantly, the output of this command is a group of files that are all required together as the index. So, within the references directory, we will create another directory called bwa/sacCer3, make a symbolic link to the yeast FASTA there, and run the index command in that directory.

    mkdir -p $WORK/archive/references/bwa/sacCer3
    cd $WORK/archive/references/bwa/sacCer3
    ln -s ../../fasta/sacCer3.fa
    ls -la

Now execute the bwa index command.

    bwa index -a bwtsw sacCer3.fa

Since the yeast genome is not large when compared to human, this should not take long to execute (otherwise we would do it as a batch job). When it is comple you should see a set of index files like this:

    sacCer3.fa
    sacCer3.fa.amb
    sacCer3.fa.ann
    sacCer3.fa.bwt
    sacCer3.fa.pac
    sacCer3.fa.sa


A common question is what contigs are in a given FASTA file. You'll usually want to know this before you start the alignment so that you're familiar with the contig naming convention – and to verify that it's the one you expect.

We saw that a FASTA consists of a number of contig entries, each one starting with a name line of the form below, followed by many lines of bases.

    >contigName

How do we dig out just the lines that have the contig names and ignore all the sequences? Well, the contig name lines all follow the pattern above, and since the > character is not a valid base, it will never appear on a sequence line.
We've discovered a pattern (also known as a regular expression) to use in searching, and the command line tool that does regular expression matching is **grep**.

Regular expressions are so powerful that nearly every modern computer language includes a "regex" module of some sort. There are many online tutorials for regular expressions (and a few different flavors of them). But the most common is the Perl style (http://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut.html). We're only going to use the most simple of regular expressions here, but learning more about them will pay handsome dividends for you in the future.

Here's how to execute grep to list contig names in a FASTA file.

    grep -P '^>' sacCer3.fa | more

**Notes:**
- The -P option tells grep to use Perl-style regular expression patterns. 
- This makes including special characters like Tab ( \t ), Carriage Return ( \r ) or Linefeed ( \n ) much easier that the default Posix paterns.
- While it is not really required here, it generally doesn't hurt to include this option.
- '^>' is the regular expression describing the pattern we're looking for (described below)
- sacCer3.fa is the file to search. Lines with text that match our pattern will be written to standard output; non matching lines will be omitted.
- We pipe to more just in case there are a lot of contig names.

Now down to the nuts and bolts of our pattern, '^>'

First, the single quotes around the pattern – they are only a signal for the bash shell. As part of its friendly command line parsing and evaluation, the shell will often look for special characters on the command line that mean something to it (for example, the $ in front of an environment variable name, like in $SCRATCH). Well, regular expressions treat the $ specially too – but in a completely different way! Those single quotes tell the shell "don't look inside here for special characters – treat this as a literal string and pass it to the program". The shell will obey, will strip the single quotes off the string, and will pass the actual pattern, ^>, to the grep program. (Aside: We've see that the shell does look inside double quotes ( " ) for certain special signals, such as looking for environment variable names to evaluate.)

So what does ^> mean to grep? Well, from our contig name format description above we see that contig name lines always start with a > character, so > is a literal for grep to use in its pattern match.

We might be able to get away with just using this literal alone as our regex, specifying '>' as the command line argument. But for grep, the more specific the pattern, the better. So we constrain where the > can appear on the line. The special carat ( ^ ) character represents "beginning of line". So ^> means "beginning of a line followed by a > character, followed by anything. (Aside: the dollar sign ( $ ) character represents "end of line" in a regex. There are many other special characters, including period ( . ), question mark ( ? ), pipe ( | ), parentheses ( ( ) ), and brackets ( [ ] ), to name the most common.)


#### Exercise: How many contigs are there in the sacCer3 reference?


### Performing the bwa alignment

Now, we're ready to execute the actual alignment, with the goal of initially producing a SAM file from the input FASTQ files and reference. First go to the align directory, and link to the sacCer3 reference directory (this will make our commands more readable).

    cd $SCRATCH/core_ngs/align
    ln -s $WORK/archive/references/bwa/sacCer3
    ls sacCer3

As our workflow indicated, we first use bwa aln on the R1 and R2 FASTQs, producing a BWA-specific .sai intermediate binary files. Since these alignments are completely independent, we can execute them in parallel in a batch job.

There are lots of options, but here is a summary of the most important ones. BWA, is a lot more complex than the options let on. If you look at the BWA manual on the web for the aln sub-command, you'll see numerous options that can increase the alignment rate (as well as decrease it), and all sorts of other things. 

-l	Controls the length of the seed (default = 32)
-k	Controls the number of mismatches allowable in the seed of each alignment (default = 2)
-n	Controls the number of mismatches (or fraction of bases in a given alignment that can be mismatches) in the entire alignment (including the seed) (default = 0.04)
-t	Controls the number of threads

The rest of the options control the details of how much a mismatch or gap is penalized, limits on the number of acceptable hits per read, and so on.  Much more information can be accessed at the BWA manual page.

For a simple alignment like this, we can just go with the default alignment parameters, with one exception. At TACC, we want to optimize our alignment speed by allocating more than one thread (-t) to the alignment. We want to run 2 tasks, and will use a minimum of one 16-core node. So we can assign 8 cores to each alignment by specifying -t 8.

Also note that bwa writes its (binary) output to standard output by default, so we need to redirect that to a .sai file. And of course we need to redirect standard error to a log file, one per file.
Create an aln.cmds file (using nano) with the following lines:

    bwa aln -t 8 sacCer3/sacCer3.fa fq/Sample_Yeast_L005_R1.cat.fastq.gz > yeast_R1.sai 2> aln.yeast_R1.log
    bwa aln -t 8 sacCer3/sacCer3.fa fq/Sample_Yeast_L005_R2.cat.fastq.gz > yeast_R2.sai 2> aln.yeast_R2.log

Since you have directed standard error to log files, you can use a neat trick to monitor the progress of the alignment: tail -f. The -f means "follow" the tail, so new lines at the end of the file are displayed as they are added to the file.

    # Use Ctrl-c to stop the output any time
    tail -f aln.yeast_R1.log

When it's done you should see two .sai files. Next we use the bwa sampe command to pair the reads and output SAM format data. For this command you provide the same reference prefix as for bwa aln, along with the two .sai files and the two original FASTQ files.

Again bwa writes its output to standard output, so redirect that to a .sam file. (Note that bwa sampe is "single threaded" – it does not have an option to use more than one processor for its work.) We'll just execute this at the command line – not in a batch job.

    bwa sampe sacCer3/sacCer3.fa yeast_R1.sai yeast_R2.sai fq/Sample_Yeast_L005_R1.cat.fastq.gz fq/Sample_Yeast_L005_R2.cat.fastq.gz > yeast_pairedend.sam

You did it!  You should now have a SAM file that contains the alignments. It's just a text file, so take a look with head, more, less, tail, or whatever you feel like. In the next section, with samtools, you'll learn some additional ways to analyze the data once you create a BAM file.

#### Exercise: What kind of information is in the first lines of the SAM file?

The SAM or BAM has a number of header lines, which all start with an at sign ( @ ). The @SQ lines describe each contig and its length. There is also a @PG  line that describes the way the bwa sampe was performed.

Exercise: How many alignment records (not header records) are in the SAM file?

This looks for the pattern  '^HWI' which is the start of every read name (which starts every alignment record).
Remember -c says just count the records, don't display them.

    grep -P -c '^HWI' yeast_pairedend.sam

Or use the -v (invert) option to tell grep to print all lines that don't match a particular pattern, here the header lines starting with @.

     grep -P -v -c '^@' yeast_pairedend.sam


After bowtie2 came out with a local alignment option, it wasn't long before bwa developed its own local alignment algorithm called BWA-MEM (for Maximal Exact Matches), implemented by the bwa mem command. bwa mem has the following advantages:

- It incorporates a lot of the simplicity of using bwa with the complexities of local alignment, enabling straightforward alignment of datasets like the mirbase data we just examined
- It can align different portions of a read to different locations on the genome
- In a long RNA-seq experiment, reads will (at some frequency) span a splice junction themselves, or a pair of reads in a paired-end library will fall on either side of a splice junction. We want to be able to align reads that do this for many reasons, from accurate transcript quantification to novel fusion transcript discovery.
- Thus, our last exercise will be the alignment of a human long RNA-seq dataset composed (by design) almost exclusively of reads that cross splice junctions.
- bwa mem was made available when we loaded the bwa module, so take a look at its usage information. The most important parameters, similar to those we've manipulated in the past two sections, are the following:

-k	Controls the minimum seed length (default = 19)
-w	Controls the "gap bandwidth", or the length of a maximum gap. This is particularly relevant for MEM, since it can determine whether a read is split into two separate alignments or is reported as one long alignment with a long gap in the middle (default = 100)
-r	Controls how long an alignment must be relative to its seed before it is re-seeded to try to find a best-fit local match (default = 1.5, e.g. the value of -k multiplied by 1.5)
-c	Controls how many matches a MEM must have in the genome before it is discarded (default = 10000)
-t	Controls the number of threads to use

    cds
    cd core_ngs/align/
    ls fq
    gunzip -c fq/human_rnaseq.fastq.gz | echo $((`wc -l`/4))









Create a ```data``` folder in your **working directory** and download the **reference genome sequence** to be used (human chromosome 21) and *simulated datasets* from **Dropbox** [data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4qkqch7gyt888h7/AABD_i9ShwryfAqGeJ0yqqF3a).
For the rest of this tutorial the **working directory** will be **cambridge_mda14** and all the **paths** will be relative to that working directory:
    
    cd cambridge_mda14
    mkdir data

##### Download reference genome from [Ensembl]

Working with NGS data requires a high-end workstations and time for building the reference genome indexes and alignment. During this tutorial we will work only with chromosome 21 to speed up the runtimes. You can download it from **Dropbox** [data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4qkqch7gyt888h7/AABD_i9ShwryfAqGeJ0yqqF3a) or from the *Download* link at the top of [Ensembl] website and then to *Download data via FTP*, you get it in only one step by going to:

[http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html](http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html)

You should see a species table with a Human (*Homo sapiens*) row and a *DNA (FASTA)* column or click at [ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/](ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/), download the chromosome 21 file (*Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa.gz*) and move it from your browser download folder to your ```data``` folder:

    mv Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa.gz path_to_local_data

**NOTE:** For working with the whole reference genome the file to be downloaded is *Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.toplevel.fa.gz*


##### Copy simulated datasets

For this hands-on we are going to use small DNA and RNA-seq datasets simulated from chromosome 21. Data has been already simulated using _dwgsim_ software from SAMtools for DNA and _BEERS_ for RNA-seq. You can copy from the shared resources from **Dropbox** [data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4qkqch7gyt888h7/AABD_i9ShwryfAqGeJ0yqqF3a) into your ``data`` directory for this practical session. Preparing the data directory:

    cp path_to_course_materials/alignment/* your_local_data/

Notice that the name of the folders and files describe the dataset, ie. ```dna_chr21_100_hq``` stands for: _DNA_ type of data from _chromosome 21_ with _100_nt read lengths of _high_ quality. Where _hq_ quality means 0.1% mutations and _lq_ quality 1% mutations. Take a few minutes to understand the different files.

**NOTE:** If you want to learn how to simulate DNA and RNA-seq for other conditions go down to the end of this tutorial.

##### Real datasets

For those with access to high-end nodes clusters you can index and simulated whole genome datasets or download real datasets from this sources:
- [1000genomes project](http://www.1000genomes.org/)
- [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/)
- [Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)


### Installing SAMtools (Optional, already installed)

Check that it is not installed by executing

    samtools

A list of commands should be printed. If not then proceed with the installation.

Download [SAMtools] from *SF Download Page* link and move to the working directory, then uncompress it.

    mv samtools-0.1.19.tar.bz2 working_directory
    cd working_directory
    tar -jxvf samtools-0.1.19.tar.bz2 
    cd samtools-0.1.19
    make

Check that is correct by executing it with no arguments, the different commands available should be printed. You can also copy it to your ```bin``` folder in your home directory, if bin folder exist, to make it available to the PATH:

    samtools
    cp samtools ~/bin


# Exercise 1: NGS Genomic DNA aligment

In this exercise we'll learn how to download, install, build the reference genome index and align in single-end and paired-end mode with the two most widely DNA aligners: *BWA* and *Bowtie2*. But first, create an ```aligners``` folder to store the software, and an ```alignments``` folder to store the results, create those folders in your *working directory* next to ```data```, you can create both folders by executing:

    mkdir aligners
    mkdir alignments

Now go to ```aligners``` and  ```alignments``` folders and create subfolders for *bwa* and *bowtie* to store the indexes and alignments results:

    cd aligners
    mkdir bwa hpg-aligner bowtie

and

    cd alignments
    mkdir bwa hpg-aligner bowtie
    
**NOTE:** Now your working directory must contain 3 folders: data (with the reference genome of chrom. 21 and simulated datasets), aligners and alignments. Your working directory should be similar to this (notice that aligners have not been downloaded):

```
.

```


### BWA
[BWA] is probably the most used aligner for DNA. AS the documentation states it consists of three different algorithms: *BWA*, *BWA-SW* and *BWA-MEM*. The first algorithm, which is the oldest, is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer sequences. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support and split alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA for 70-100bp Illumina reads.

All these three algorithms come in the same binary so only one download and installation is needed.

##### Download and install (Optional, already installed)

First check that bwa is not currently installed by executing:

    bwa

A list of commands will be printed if already installed. If not you can continue with the installation.

You can click on ```SF download page``` link in the [BWA] page or click directly to:

Click in the last version of BWA and wait for a few seconds, as the time of this tutorial last version is **bwa-0.7.10.tar.bz2**, the download will start. When downloaded go to your browser download folder and move it to aligners folder, uncompress it and compile it:

    mv bwa-0.7.10.tar.bz2 working_directory/aligners/bwa
    tar -jxvf bwa-0.7.10.tar.bz2
    cd bwa-0.7.10
    make
    cp bwa ~/bin

You can check that everything is allright by executing:

    bwa

Some information about the software and commands should be listed.


##### Build the index

Create a folder inside ```aligners/bwa``` folder called ```index``` to store the BWA index and copy the reference genome into it:
    
    mkdir index
    cp  data/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa  aligners/bwa/index/   (this path can be different!)
    
Now you can create the index by executing:

    bwa index aligners/bwa/index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa

Some files will be created in the ```index``` folder, those files constitute the index that BWA uses.

**NOTE:** The index must created only once, it will be used for all the different alignments with BWA.


##### Aligning with new BWA-MEM in both single-end (SE) and paired-end (PE) modes

BWA-MEM is the recommended algorithm to use now. You can check the options by executing:

    bwa mem

To align **SE** with BWA-MEM execute:

    bwa mem -t 4 -R "@RG\tID:foo\tSM:bar\tPL:Illumina\tPU:unit1\tLB:lib1" aligners/bwa/index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa data/dna_chr21_100_hq_read1.fastq > alignments/bwa/dna_chr21_100_hq_se.sam

Now you can use SAMtools to create the BAM file from the *alignment/bwa* folder:
    cd alignments/bwa
    samtools view -S -b dna_chr21_100_hq_se.sam -o dna_chr21_100_hq_se.bam


To align **PE** with BWA-MEM just execute the same command line with the two FASTQ files:

    bwa mem -t 4 -R "@RG\tID:foo\tSM:bar\tPL:Illumina\tPU:unit1\tLB:lib1" aligners/bwa/index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa data/dna_chr21_100_hq_read1.fastq data/dna_chr21_100_hq_read2.fastq > alignments/bwa/dna_chr21_100_hq_pe.sam
    
Now you can use SAMtools to create the BAM file from the *alignment/bwa* folder:

    cd alignments/bwa
    samtools view -S -b dna_chr21_100_hq_pe.sam -o dna_chr21_100_hq_pe.bam


Now you can do the same for the **low** quality datasets.


##### Aligning with old BWA algorithm, two command lines: ALN and SAMSE/SAMPE in SE and PE modes (Optional exercise)

Now we are going to align SE and PE the **high** quality dataset. Single-end alignment with BWA requires 2 executions. The first uses ```aln``` command and takes the ```fastq``` file and creates a ```sai``` file; the second execution uses ```samse``` and the ```sai``` file and create the ```sam``` file. Results are stored in ```alignments``` folder:

    bwa aln aligners/bwa/index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa -t 4 data/dna_chr21_100_hq_read1.fastq -f alignments/bwa/dna_chr21_100_hq_se.sai
    bwa samse aligners/bwa/index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa alignments/bwa/dna_chr21_100_hq_se.sai data/dna_chr21_100_hq_read1.fastq -f alignments/bwa/dna_chr21_100_hq_se.sam


For paired-end alignments with BWA 3 executions are needed: 2 for ```aln``` command and 1 for ```sampe``` command:

    bwa aln aligners/bwa/index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa -t 4 data/dna_chr21_100_hq_read1.fastq -f alignments/bwa/dna_chr21_100_hq_pe1.sai
    bwa aln aligners/bwa/index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa -t 4 data/dna_chr21_100_hq_read2.fastq -f alignments/bwa/dna_chr21_100_hq_pe2.sai
    bwa sampe aligners/bwa/index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa alignments/bwa/dna_chr21_100_hq_pe1.sai alignments/bwa/dna_chr21_100_hq_pe2.sai data/dna_chr21_100_hq_read1.fastq data/dna_chr21_100_hq_read2.fastq -f alignments/bwa/dna_chr21_100_hq_pe.sam

Now you can use SAMtools to create the BAM file from the *alignment/bwa* folder:

    cd alignments/bwa
    samtools view -S -b dna_chr21_100_hq_se.sam -o dna_chr21_100_hq_se.bam
    samtools view -S -b dna_chr21_100_hq_pe.sam -o dna_chr21_100_hq_pe.bam

Now you can do the same for the **low** quality datasets.


### HPG Aligner
[HPG Aligner] is an ultrafast and high sensitivity tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It is particularly good at aligning reads of any size. HPG Aligner 2.0 indexes the genome using a Suffix Arrays. HPG Aligner 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes, together with INDEL realignment and recalibration.

##### Build the index

Create a folder inside HPG Aligner program called ```index``` to store the HPG Aligner index and copy the reference genome into it:
    
    cd hpg-aligner   (_inside aligners folder_)
    mkdir index
    cp data/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa aligners/bwa/index/
    
Now you can create the index by executing:

    hpg-aligner build-sa-index -g aligners/hpg-aligner/index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa -i aligners/hpg-aligner/index/

Some files will be created in the ```index``` folder, those files constitute the index that HPG Aligner uses.

**NOTE:** The index must created only once, it will be used for all the different alignments with HPG Aligner.

### Bowtie2

[Bowtie2] as documentation states is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It is particularly good at aligning reads of about 50 up to few 100s. Bowtie 2 indexes the genome with an FM Index to keep its memory footprint small: for the human genome, its memory footprint is typically around 3.2 GB. Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes.

##### Download and install (Optional, already installed)

First check that bwa is not currently installed by executing:

    bowtie2

A list of commands will be printed if already installed. If not you can continue with the installation.

From [Bowtie2] go to ```Latest Release``` and download the program or go directly to:

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie2/2.2.3/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie2/2.2.3/)

Click in the Linux version of Bowtie2 and wait for a few seconds, as the time of this tutorial last version is **bowtie2-2.2.3-linux-x86_64.zip**, the download will start. When downloaded go to your browser download folder and move it to aligners folder and uncompress it. No need to compile if you downloaded the Linux version:

    mv bowtie2-2.2.3-linux-x86_64.zip working_directory/aligners/bowtie
    unzip bowtie2-2.2.3-linux-x86_64.zip
    cd bowtie2-2.2.3

You can check that everything is allright by executing:

    bowtie2

Big information about the software and commands should be listed.


##### Build the index

Create a folder inside Bowtie2 program called ```index``` to store the Bowtie2 index and copy the reference genome into it:
    
    cd bowtie   (_inside aligners folder_)
    mkdir index
    cp data/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa aligners/bowtie/index/
    
Now you can create the index by executing:

    bowtie2-build aligners/bowtie/index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa aligners/bowtie/index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa

Some files will be created in the ```index``` folder, those files constitute the index that Bowtie2 uses.

**NOTE:** The index must created only once, it will be used for all the different alignments with Bowtie2.


##### Aligning in SE and PE modes

Mapping **SE** with Bowtie2 requires only 1 execution, for aligning the **high** in SE mode execute:

    bowtie2 -q -p 4 -x aligners/bowtie/index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa -U data/dna_chr21_100_hq_read1.fastq -S alignments/bowtie/dna_chr21_100_hq_se.sam

And create the BAM file using SAMtools;

    cd alignments/bowtie
    samtools view -S -b dna_chr21_100_hq_se.sam -o dna_chr21_100_hq_se.bam


Mapping in **PE** also requires only one execution:

    bowtie2 -q -p 4 -x aligners/bowtie/index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa -1 data/dna_chr21_100_hq_read1.fastq -2 data/dna_chr21_100_hq_read2.fastq -S alignments/bowtie/dna_chr21_100_hq_pe.sam

And create the BAM file using SAMtools;

    cd alignments/bowtie
    samtools view -S -b dna_chr21_100_hq_pe.sam -o dna_chr21_100_hq_pe.bam
    
Repeat the same steps for the **low** quality dataset.


### More exercises

- Try to simulate datasets with longer reads and more mutations to study which aligner behaves better
- Test the aligner sensitivity to INDELS
- Try BWA-MEM algorithm and compare sensitivity. The same index is valid, only one execution for the SAM file ```./bwa mem index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.chromosome.21.fa ../../data/dna_chr21_100_low/dna_chr21_100_low.bwa.read1.fastq```
