# Getting around in the shell

## Important keyboard shortcuts

Type as little and as accurately as possible by using keyboard shortcuts!

### Tab key completion

The Tab key is your best friend! Hit the Tab key once or twice - it's almost always magic! Hitting Tab invokes "shell completion", instructing the shell to try to guess what you're doing and finish the typing for you. On most modern Linux shells, Tab completion will:
-   complete file or directory names up to any ambiguous part (single Tab)
-   if nothing shows up, there is no unambiguous match
-   display all possible completions (Tab twice)
-   you then decide where to go next
-   work for shell commands too (like rsync or chmod)


### Up arrow
Use "up arrow" to retrieve any of the last 500 commands you've typed, going backwards through your history. You can then edit them and hit Enter (even in the middle of the command) and the shell will use that command. The down arrow "scrolls" forward from where you are in the command history.


### Ctrl-a, Ctrl-e
You can use Ctrl-a (holding down the "control" key and "a") to jump the cursor right to the beginning of the line. The omega to that alpha is Ctrl-e, which jumps the cursor to the end of the line. Arrow keys work, and Ctrl-arrow will skip by word forward and backward.

### Wildcards and special file names

The shell has shorthand to refer to groups of files by allowing wildcards in file names.
* (asterisk) is the most common filename wildcard. It matches "any length of any characters".

* Other useful ones are brackets ( [ ] ) to allow for any character in the list of characters between the brackets. And you can use a hyphen ( - ) to specify a range of characters

For example:
-   **ls *.bam** – lists all files in the current directory that end in .bam
-   **ls [A-Z]*.bam** – does the same, but only if the first character of the file is a capital letter
-   **ls [ABab]*.bam** – lists all .bam files whose 1st letter is A, B, a or b.

Three special file names:
-   . (single period) means "this directory".
-   .. (two periods) means "directory above current." So ls -l .. means "list contents of the parent directory."
-   ~ (tilde) means "my home directory".


### Environment variables

Environment variables are just like variables in a programming language (in fact bash is a complete programming language), they are "pointers" that reference data assigned to them. In bash, you assign an environment variable as shown below:

    export varname="Some value, here it's a string"


**NOTE:** Be careful – do not put spaces around the equals sign when assigning environment variable values. Also, always use double quotes if your value contains (or might contain) spaces.

You set environment variables using the bare name (varname above).
You then refer to or evaluate an environment variables using a dollar sign ( $ ) before the name:

    echo $varname

The export keyword when you're setting ensures that any sub-processes that are invoked will inherit this value. Without the export only the current shell process will have that variable set.

Use the env command to see all the environment variables you currently have set

## Standard streams

Every command and Linux program has three "built-in" streams: standard input, standard output and standard error.


![Terminal Example](https://wikis.utexas.edu/download/attachments/66698131/std_streams.png?version=1&modificationDate=1400467628000&api=v2)

### redirecting output
-   To take the standard output of a program and save it to a file, you use the ```>``` operator
-   a single ```>``` overwrites any existing target; a double ```>>``` appends to it
-   since standard output is stream #1, this is the same as ```>1```
-   To redirect the standard error of a program you must specify its stream number using```2>```
-   To redirect standard output and standard error to the same place, use the syntax ```2>&1```

To see the difference between standard output and standard error try these commands:

    # redirect a long listing of your $HOME directory to a file
    ls -la $HOME > cmd.out
    # look at the contents -- you'll see just files
    cat cmd.out
    # this command gives an error because the target does not exist
    ls -la bad_directory
    # redirect any errors from ls to a fil
    ls -la bad_directory 2> cmd.out
    # look at the contents -- you'll see an error message
    cat cmd.out
    # now redirect both error and output streams to the same place
    ls -la bad_directory $HOME > cmd.out
    # look at the contents -- you'll see both an error message and files
    cat cmd.out

## piping
The power of the Linux command line is due in no small part to the power of piping. The pipe symbol ( | ) connects one program's standard output to the next program's standard input.

![Terminal Example](https://wikis.utexas.edu/download/attachments/66698131/piping.png?version=1&modificationDate=1400467637000&api=v2)

A simple example is piping uncompressed data "on the fly" to a pager like more:

    # the -c option says to write decompressed data to the console (stdout)
    gunzip -c big.fq.gz | more

But the real power comes when you stitch together a string of commands with pipes – it's incredibly flexible, and fun once you get the hang.

    # create a histogram of mapping quality scores for the 1st 1000 mapped bam records
    samtools view -F 0x4 small.bam | head -1000 | cut -f 5 | sort -n | uniq -c

## Using Commands

### Command options

Sitting at the computer, you should have some idea what you need to do. There's probably a command to do it. If you have some idea what it starts with, you can type a few characters and hit Tab twice to get some help. If you have no idea, you Google it or ask someone else.

Once you know a basic command, you'll soon want it to do a bit more - like seeing the sizes of files in addition to their names.
Most built-in commands in Linux use a common syntax to ask more of a command. They usually add a dash ( - ) followed by a code letter that names the added function. These "command line switches" are called options.

Options are, well, optional – you only add them when you need them. The part of the command line after the options, like filenames, are called arguments. Arguments can also be optional, but you can tell them from options because they don't start with a dash.

    # long listing option (-l)
    ls -l
    # long listing (-l), all files (-a) and human readable file sizes (-h) options. $HOME is an argument (directory name)
    ls -l -a -h $HOME
    # sort by modification time (-t) displaying a long listing (-l) that includes the date and time
    ls -lt

Almost all commands, and especially NGS tools, use options heavily.

Like dialects in a language, there are at least three basic schemes commands/programs accept options in:


1.  **Single-letter short options**, which start with a single dash ( - ) and can often be combined, like:


    head -20 # show 1st 20 lines            
    ls -lhtS (equivalent to ls -l -h -t -S)
    
2.  **Long options** use the convention that double dashes ( -- ) precede the multi-character option name, and they can never be combined. Strictly speaking, long options should be separated from their values by the equals sign ( = ) according to the Posix standard. But most programs let you use a space as separator also. Here's an example using the mira genome assembler:


    mira --project=ct --job=denovo,genome,accurate,454 -SK:not=8

3.  **Word options**, illustrated in the GATK command line to call SNPs below. Word options combine aspects of short and long options – they usually start with a single dash ( - ), but can be multiple letters and are never combined. Sometimes the option (e.g. java's -Xms initial memory heap size option), and its value (512m which means 512 megabytes) may be smashed together. Other times a multi-letter switch and its value are separated by a space (e.g. -glm BOTH).


    java -d64 -Xms512m -Xmx4g -jar /work/01866/phr254/gshare/Tools_And_Programs/bin/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -glm BOTH -R $reference -T UnifiedGenotyper -I $outprefix.realigned.recal.bam --dbsnp $dbsnp -o $outprefix.snps.vcf -metrics snps.metrics -stand_call_conf 50.0 -stand_emit_conf 10.0 -dcov 1000 -A DepthOfCoverage -A AlleleBalance

### Getting help

So you've noticed that options can be complicated – not to mention program arguments. Some options have values and others don't. Some are short, others long. How do you figure out what kinds of functions a command (or NGS tool) offers? You need help!

**--help option**

Many (but not all) built-in shell commands will give you some help if you provide the long --help option. This can often be many pages, so you'll probably want to pipe the output to a pager like more. This is most useful to remind yourself what the name of that dang option was, assuming you know something about it.

**-h or -? options**

The -h and -? options are similar to --help. If --help doesn't work, try -h. or -?. Again, output can be lengthy and best used if you already have an idea what the program does.

Many 3rd party tools will provide extensive usage information if you just type the program name then hit Enter.

For example:

    bwa
    
Produces something like this:

    Program: bwa (alignment via Burrows-Wheeler transformation)
    Version: 0.7.7-r441
    Contact: Heng Li <lh3@sanger.ac.uk>
    Usage:   bwa <command> [options]
    Command: index         index sequences in the FASTA format
         mem           BWA-MEM algorithm
         fastmap       identify super-maximal exact matches
         pemerge       merge overlapping paired ends (EXPERIMENTAL)
         aln           gapped/ungapped alignment
         samse         generate alignment (single ended)
         sampe         generate alignment (paired ended)
         bwasw         BWA-SW for long queries
         fa2pac        convert FASTA to PAC format
         pac2bwt       generate BWT from PAC
         pac2bwtgen    alternative algorithm for generating BWT
         bwtupdate     update .bwt to the new format
         bwt2sa        generate SA from BWT and Occ
    Note: To use BWA, you need to first index the genome with `bwa index'.
        There are three alignment algorithms in BWA: `mem', `bwasw', and
      `aln/samse/sampe'. If you are not sure which to use, try `bwa mem'
      first. Please `man ./bwa.1' for the manual.

Notice that bwa, like many NGS programs, is written as a set of sub-commands. This top-level help displays the sub-commands available. You then type bwa <command> to see help for the sub-command:

    bwa index
    
Displays something like this:



    Usage:  bwa index [-a bwtsw|is] [-c] <in.fasta>    
    Options: -a STR    BWT construction algorithm: bwtsw or is [auto]
         -p STR    prefix of the index [same as fasta name]
         -6        index files named as <in.fasta>.64.* instead of <in.fasta>.*
    Warning: `-a bwtsw' does not work for short genomes, while `-a is' and
         `-a div' do not work not for long genomes. Please choose `-a'
         according to the length of the genome.


####Google

If you don't already know much about a command (or NGS tool), just Google it! Try something like "bwa manual" or "rsync man page". Many tools have websites that combine tool overviews with detailed option help. Even for built-in Linux commands, you're likely to get hits of a tutorial style, which are more useful when you're getting started.
And it's so much easier to read things in a nice web browser!

#### man pages
Linux has had built-in help files since the mid-1500's, way before Macs or PCs thought of such things. They're called man pages (short for manual).
For example, man intro will give you an introduction to all user commands.

man pages will detail all options available – in excruciating detail (unless there's no man page (smile)), so the manual system has its own built-in pager. The pager is sort of like less, but not quite the same (why make it easy?). We recommend man pages only for advanced users.

### Basic linux commands you need to know
Here's a copy of the cheat sheet we passed out.

And here's  a set of commands you should know, by category (under construction).

#### File system navigation
-   ls - list the contents of the current directory
-   cd <whereto> - change the present working directory to <whereto>. Some special <wheretos>:
-   .. (period, period) means "up one level"
-   ~ (tilde) means "my home directory"
-   file <file> tells you what kind of file <file> is
-   df shows you the top level of the directory structure of the system you're working on, along with how much disk space is available
-   pwd - display the present working directory. The format is something like /home/myID - just like on most computer systems, this represents leaves on the tree of the file system structure, also called a "path".

#### Create and delete files
-   mkdir -p <dirname> create directory <dirname>.
-   rm <file> deletes a file. This is permanent - not a "trash can" deletion.
-   ln -s create a symbolic link
-   touch - create an empty file

#### Displaying file contents
-   cat <file> outputs all the contents of <file> - CAUTION - only use on small files.
-   more <file> and
-   less <file> both display the contents of <file> in nice ways. Read the bit above about man to figure out how to navigate and search when using less
-   head <file> and tail <file> shows you the top or bottom 10 lines of a file <file>

#### Copying files and directories
-   cp <source> <destination> copies the file source to the location and/or file name destination}. Using . (period) means "here, with the same name". * cp -r <dirname> <destination> will recursively copy the directory dirname and all its contents to the directory destination.
-   scp <user>@<host>:<source> <destination> works just like cp but copies source from the user user's directory on remote machine host to the local file destination
-   wget <url> fetches a file from a valid URL.
-   rsync

#### Miscellaneous commands
-   history
-   which
#### Advanced commands
-   cut
-   sort
-   uniq
-   grep
-   awk

### Editing files
There are several options for editing files at TACC. These fall into three categories:
- Linux text editors installed at TACC (nano, vi, emacs). These run in your Terminal window. nano is extremely simple and is the best choice as a first local text editor. vi and emacs are extremely powerful but also quite complex
- Text editors or IDEs that run on your local computer but have an SFTP (secure FTP) interface that lets you connect to a remote computer (Notepad++ or Komodo Edit). 
    -  Once you connect to the remote host, you can navigate its directory structure and edit files.
    -   When you open a file, its contents are brought over the network into the text editor's edit window, then saved back when you save the file.
-   Software that will allow you to mount your home directory on TACC as if it were a normal disk (e.g. ExpanDrive for Windows or Mac – costs $$, but has a free trial).  Then, you can use any text editor or IDE on your local computer to open/edit/save files (although it will be slower than local file editing)


#### Line ending nightmares
The dirty little secret of the computer world is that the three main "families" of computers – Macs, Windows and Linux/Unix – use different, mutually incompatible line endings.
-   Linux/Unix uses linefeed ( \n )
-   Windows uses carriage return followed by linefeed ( \r\n )
-   some Mac programs use carriage return only ( \r )
And guess what? Most Linux programs don't work with files that have Windows or Mac line endings, and what's worse they give you bizarre error messages that don't give you a clue what's going on.

So whatever non-Linux text editor you use, be sure to adjust its "line endings" setting – and it better have one somewhere!

#### nano
nano is a very simple editor available on most Linux systems. If you are able to ssh into a remote system, you can use nano there.
-   To invoke it, creating a new file, just type:
-   Start the nano text editor on a new (un-named) file
        
    


        nano

-   You'll see a short menu of operations at the bottom of the terminal window. The most important are:
    -   ctl-o - write out the file
    -   ctl-x - exit nano

-   You can just type in text, and navigate around using arrow keys. A couple of other navigation shortcuts:
    -   ctl-a - go to start of line
    -   ctl-e - go to end of line


#### Komodo Edit for Mac and Windows
Komodo Edit is a free, full-featured text editor with syntax coloring for many programming languages and a remote file editing interface. It has versions for both Macintosh and Windows. Download the appropriate install image here.

Once installed, start Komodo Edit and follow these steps to configure it:
-   Configure the default line separator for Unix
-   On the Edit menu select Preferences
-   Select the New Files Category
-   For Specify the end-of-line (EOL) indicator for newly created files select UNIX (\n)
-   Select OK
-   Configure a connection to TACC
-   On the Edit menu select Preferences
-   Select the Servers Category
-   For Server type select SFTP
-   Give this profile the Name of stampede 
-   For Hostname enter stampede.tacc.utexas.edu
-   Enter your TACC user ID for Username
-   Leave Port and Default path blank
-   Select OK
-   When you want to open an existing file at Lonestar, do the following:
    -   Select the File menu -> Open -> Remote File
    -   Select your stampede profile from the top Server drop-down menu
-   Once you log in, it should show you all the files and directories in your stampede $HOME directory
-   Navigate to the file you want and open it
-   Often you will use the work or scratch directory links to help you here
-   To create and save a new file, do the following:
    -   From the Komodo Edit Start Page, select New File
    -   Select the file type (Text is good for commands files)
-   Edit the contents
    -   Select the File menu -> Save As Other -> Remote File
    -   Select your stampede profile from the Server drop-down menu
    -   Once you log in, it should show you all the files and directories in your stampede $HOME directory
    -   Navigate to where you want the put the file and save it
    -   Often you will use the work or scratch directory links to help you here
    -   Rather than having to navigate around TACC's complex file system tree, it helps to use the symbolic links to those areas that we created in your home directory.
